I need you to write a descriptive commit message for the staged changes.

- Follow all conventions and requirements described in .cursor/rules/git-commit-conventions.mdc.
- The commit message must be clear, concise, and accurately describe the intent and impact of the changes.
- Do NOT use co-authorship or add any co-author lines to the commit message.
- If the commit includes multiple logical changes, summarize each in a separate bullet point or paragraph as appropriate.
- If the commit fixes a bug, references an issue, or implements a feature, mention it explicitly in the message.
- Do not include any unrelated or boilerplate text.

Always review the diff and ensure the message reflects the actual changes made.
